Course Project - The Basics 

Planning the App - shopping list

Make sure, you do create that app by also adding the --no-strict, --routing false and --standalone false flags to the ng new command - otherwise you will run into issues later on (we'll still dive into that "Strict Mode" later in the course of course, no worries)!

We'll also install the Bootstrap CSS Framework and in this course, we use version 3 of the framework. Install it via npm install --save bootstrap@3  => The @3  is important!

Additionally, when using a project created with Angular CLI 6+ (check via ng v ), you'll have an angular.json  file instead of an .angular-cli.json  file. In that file, you still need to add Bootstrap to the styles[]  array as shown in the next video, but the path should be node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css , NOT ../node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css . The leading ../  must not be included.

After planning I started with creation of the Navigaton bar

There is a Alternative Navigation bar provided by the course as well

Alternative Non-Collapsable Navigation Bar
The way we added it, the Navbar will collapse on smaller screens. Since we didn't implement a Hamburger menu, that means that there's no way of accessing our links on smaller screens.

You can either add such a menu on your own (see below), or you replace collapse navbar-collapse  with just navbar-default.

Adding a Hamburger Menu:

Alternatively, if you want to make the navigation bar responsive, please replace these lines in header.component.html:

<div class="navbar-header">
  <a routerLink="/" class="navbar-brand">Recipe Book</a>
</div>
<div class="collapse navbar-collapse">
with these lines:

<div class="navbar-header">
  <button type="button" class="navbar-toggle" (click)="collapsed = !collapsed">
	<span class="icon-bar" *ngFor="let iconBar of [1, 2, 3]"></span>
  </button>
  <a routerLink="/" class="navbar-brand">Recipe Book</a>
</div>
<div class="navbar-collapse" [class.collapse]="collapsed" (window:resize)="collapsed = true">
and add this line to header.component.ts:

collapsed = true;

[End of the Alternative Navigation bar instruction]
