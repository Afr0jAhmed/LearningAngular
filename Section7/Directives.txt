^What are Directives
In Angular, Directives are defined as classes that can add new behavior to the 
elements in the template or modify existing behavior. 

The purpose of Directives
in Angular is to maneuver the DOM, be it by adding new elements to DOM or removing
elements and even changing the appearance of the DOM elements.

^Attribute Vs structural 

Looks like a normal HTML attribute only affect/change the element they are added to
whereas structural affect a whole area in the DOM (elements get added/removed)
