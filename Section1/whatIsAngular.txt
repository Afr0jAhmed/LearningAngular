lesson 1-7

^What is Angular?

Angular is a JavaScript Framework which allows you to create reactive Single-page-Applications (SPAs).

You can navigate around but the page never changes and if we need some data we'll load that in the background 
so the user has a seemless experience of everything happening instantly.

^Understanding Angular Versioning

Angularjs - Angular 1
    complete Re-write
Angular 2
Angular 4
    Releases major version 
Angular 12
    backward compatible changes       

A lot of problems are solved by making sure you're using the latest version of NodeJS, npm and the CLI itself.

Updating NodeJS:

Go to nodejs.org and download the latest version - uninstall (all) installed versions on your machine first.

Updating npm:

Run [sudo] npm install -g npm  (sudo  is only required on Mac/ Linux)

Updating the CLI

[sudo] npm uninstall -g angular-cli @angular/cli 

npm cache verify 

[sudo] npm install -g @angular/cli 

Here are some common issues & solutions:

Creation of a new project takes forever (longer than 3 minutes)
That happens on Windows from time to time => Try running the command line as administrator

You get an EADDR error (Address already in use)
You might already have another ng serve process running - make sure to quit that or use ng serve --port ANOTHERPORT  to serve your project on a new port

we can quit the server or run multiple servers on different ports 

My changes are not reflected in the browser (App is not compiling)
Check if the window running ng serve  displays an error. If that's not the case, make sure you're using the latest CLI version and try restarting your CLI

ng new my-first-app --no-strict --standalone false --routing false   << to create the angular app

by adding keywords with dashes we are disabling certain features which are not required for the basics

cd my-first--app to navigate to the folder

ng serve  << will open up a development server on a port
should not quit by pressing ctrl+c as we can do in React 
we should keep the server running as long as we are working on the code

Detects changes and automatically reloads 

while inspecting the page it will show the index html which has dynamically injected script code
