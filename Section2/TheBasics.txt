Creating new components along with bootstrap that was created in the previous module

<h3>I'm in the App component</h3>

Working with Standalone Components

Depending on the Angular version your project is using, you can also build Components in a different way: As "Standalone Components".

The main idea behind Standalone Components is that you can build Angular components & apps without (or with less) @NgModules - i.e., Standalone Components allow you to write less (boilerplate) code.

How Are Standalone Components Built?
You build a standalone component by adding the standalone: true property/value pair to the @Component decorator.

Like this:

@Component({
  standalone: true,
  selector: 'app-cmp',
  template: '<h1>I work standalone!</h1>'
})
export class SomeComponent {}
Such components then don't have to (and shouldn't be) added to any @NgModule.

Therefore, if you only work with such components, no @NgModule is needed at all.

To "tell Angular" which features should be available in a Standalone Component (e.g., which other component selectors can be used there), you have to add the special imports property to the @Component selector.

Like this:

@Component({
  standalone: true,
  selector: 'app-cmp',
  template: '<app-some-other-component />',
  imports: [SomeOtherComponent]
})
export class SomeComponent {}
But again, you'll learn more about this later in the course, in a dedicated section.

Should You Use Standalone Components
Standalone components can reduce the amount of boilerplate code you have to write - after all, you don't have to add and manage those extra @NgModules anymore.
