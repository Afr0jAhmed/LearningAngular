Extends javaScript

adds static typing to javaScript

having static typing could enhance the code and prevent errors

npm install typescript 
To install globally
npm install -g typescript

npm init -y
to create an empty package json file

npm tsc filename
npm tsc with-typescript.ts 
will check for errors in the file

by default typeScript tries to infer as many types as possible 
even without them being defined
